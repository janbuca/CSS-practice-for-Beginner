    CSS Combinators
        A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
        A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
        There are four different combinators in CSS:
        descendant selector (space)
        child selector (>)
        adjacent sibling selector (+)
        general sibling selector (~)
