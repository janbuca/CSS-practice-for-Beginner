        4.3 First XHTML Example
        This chapter presents XHTML markup and provides screen captures that show how a
        browser renders (i.e., displays) the XHTML. You can download the examples from
        www.deitel.com/books/iw3htp4. Every XHTML document we show has line numbers
        for the reader’s convenience—these line numbers are not part of the XHTML documents.
        As you read this book, open each XHTML document in your web browser so you can view
        and interact with it as it was originally intended.
        Figure 4.1 is an XHTML document named main.html. This first example displays

        the message “Welcome to XHTML!” in the browser. The key line in the program is line
        13, which tells the browser to display “Welcome to XHTML!” Now let us consider each
        line of the program.
        Lines 1–3 are required in XHTML documents to conform with proper XHTML
        syntax. For now, copy and paste these lines into each XHTML document you create. The
        meaning of these lines is discussed in detail in Chapter 14.
        Lines 5–6 are XHTML comments. XHTML document creators insert comments to
        improve markup readability and describe the content of a document. Comments also help
        other people read and understand an XHTML document’s markup and content. Comments
        do not cause the browser to perform any action when the user loads the XHTML
