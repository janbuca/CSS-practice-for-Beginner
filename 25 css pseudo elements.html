        4.3 First XHTML Example
            This chapter presents XHTML markup and provides screen captures that show how a
            browser renders (i.e., displays) the XHTML. You can download the examples from
            www.deitel.com/books/iw3htp4. Every XHTML document we show has line numbers
            for the reader’s convenience—these line numbers are not part of the XHTML documents.
            As you read this book, open each XHTML document in your web browser so you can view
            and interact with it as it was originally intended.
            Figure 4.1 is an XHTML document named main.html. This first example displays
            the message “Welcome to XHTML!” in the browser. The key line in the program is line
            13, which tells the browser to display “Welcome to XHTML!” Now let us consider each
            line of the program.
