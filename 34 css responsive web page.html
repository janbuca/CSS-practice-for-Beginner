    What is Responsive Web Design?
        Responsive web design makes your web page look good on all devices.
        Responsive web design uses only HTML and CSS.
        Responsive web design is not a program or a JavaScript.

    What is The Viewport?
        The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.
        The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

    Setting The Viewport
        You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages:

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device
        (which will vary depending on the device).

    The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.


    Responsive Web Design - Grid-View
        Using a grid-view is very helpful when designing web pages. It makes it easier to place elements on the page.

    A responsive grid-view often has 12 columns, and has a total width of 100%,
        and will shrink and expand as you resize the browser window.

    First ensure that all HTML elements have the box-sizing property set to border-box.
    This makes sure that the padding and border
    are included in the total width and height of the elements.

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Programming is a skill that can be acquired by a computer professional that
    gives him/her the knowledge of making the computer perform the required operation or task. </p>
    <p> Computer programming is critical if one wants to know how to make the computer perform a
    task. Most users of a computer only use the available applications on the computer.
    These applications are produced by computer programmers.
    Thus if someone is interested to make such kind of applications, he/she needs
    to learn how to talk to the computer, which is learning computer programming. </p>
