            Assign filenames to documents that describe their functionality. This practice can help you identify
            documents faster. It also helps people who want to link to a page, by giving them an easy-tormenter
            name. For example, if you are writing an XHTML document that contains product
            information, you might want to call it products.html. 4.1
            Computers called web servers running specialized software store XHTML documents.
            Clients (e.g., web browsers) request specific resources such as the XHTML documents
            from web servers. For example, typing www.deitel.com/books/downloads.html
            into a web browser’s address field requests downloads.html from the books directory on
            the web server running at www.deitel.com.We discuss web servers in detail in Chapter 21.
            For now, we simply place the XHTML documents on our computer and render them by
        </div>
        <div class = "hidden">
            opening them locally with a web browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox.
            4.3 First XHTML Example
            This chapter presents XHTML markup and provides screen captures that show how a
            browser renders (i.e., displays) the XHTML. You can download the examples from
            www.deitel.com/books/iw3htp4. Every XHTML document we show has line numbers
            for the reader’s convenience—these line numbers are not part of the XHTML documents.
            As you read this book, open each XHTML document in your web browser so you can view
            and interact with it as it was originally intended.

            Figure 4.1 is an XHTML document named main.html. This first example displays
        </div>
        <div class = "scroll">
            the message “Welcome to XHTML!” in the browser. The key line in the program is line
            13, which tells the browser to display “Welcome to XHTML!” Now let us consider each
            line of the program.
            Lines 1–3 are required in XHTML documents to conform with proper XHTML
            syntax. For now, copy and paste these lines into each XHTML document you create. The
            meaning of these lines is discussed in detail in Chapter 14.
            Lines 5–6 are XHTML comments. XHTML document creators insert comments to
            improve markup readability and describe the content of a document. Comments also help
            other people read and understand an XHTML document’s markup and content. Comments
            do not cause the browser to perform any action when the user loads the XHTML
